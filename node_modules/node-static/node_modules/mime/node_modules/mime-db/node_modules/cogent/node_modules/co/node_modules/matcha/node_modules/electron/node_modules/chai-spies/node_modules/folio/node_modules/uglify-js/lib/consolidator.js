/**
 * @fileoverview Enhances <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/"
 * >UglifyJS</a> with consolidation of null, Boolean, and String values.
 * <p>Also known as aliasing, this feature has been deprecated in <a href=
 * "http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/">the Closure Compiler</a> since its
 * initial release, where it is unavailable from the <abbr title=
 * "command line interface">CLI</a>. The Closure Compiler allows one to log and
 * influence this process. In contrast, this implementation does not introduce
 * any variable declarations in global code and derives String values from
 * identifier names used as property accessors.</p>
 * <p>Consolidating literals may worsen the data compression ratio when an <a
 * href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.5">encoding
 * transformation</a> is applied. For instance, <a href=
 * "http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.js">jQuery 1.7.1</a> takes 248235 bytes.
 * Building it with <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/tarball/v1.2.5">
 * UglifyJS v1.2.5</a> results in 93647 bytes (37.73% of the original) which are
 * then compressed to 33154 bytes (13.36% of the original) using <a href=
 * "http://linux.die.net/man/1/gzip">gzip(1)</a>. Building it with the same
 * version of UglifyJS 1.2.5 patched with the implementation of consolidation
 * results in 80784 bytes (a decrease of 12863 bytes, i.e. 13.74%, in comparison
 * to the aforementioned 93647 bytes) which are then compressed to 34013 bytes
 * (an increase of 859 bytes, i.e. 2.59%, in comparison to the aforementioned
 * 33154 bytes).</p>
