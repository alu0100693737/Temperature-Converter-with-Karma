# Release Notes

## 2.0.0 / 2015-02-09

Unfortunately with 1.10.0 - compatibility broke with older versions because of
the `addChainableNoop`. This change has been reverted.

Any plugins using `addChainableNoop` should cease to do so.

Any developers wishing for this behaviour can use [dirty-chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dirty-chai)

### Noop Function for Terminating Assertion Properties

The following assertions can now also be used in the function-call form:

* ok
* true
* false
* null
* undefined
* exist
* empty
* arguments
* Arguments

The above list of assertions are property getters that assert immediately on
access. Because of that, they were written to be used by terminating the assertion
chain with a property access.

```js
expect(true).to.be.true;
foo.should.be.ok;
```

This syntax is definitely aesthetically pleasing but, if you are linting your
test code, your linter will complain with an error something like "Expected an
assignment or function call and instead saw an expression." Since the linter
doesn't know about the property getter it assumes this line has no side-effects,
and throws a warning in case you made a mistake.

Squelching these errors is not a good solution as test code
