# Creating tasks

Tasks are grunt's bread and butter. The stuff you do most often, like `concat` or `test`. Every time grunt is run, you specify one more more tasks, which tells grunt what you'd like it to do.

_Note: if you don't specify a task, but a task named "default" has been defined, that task will run (unsurprisingly) by default._

Tasks can be created in a few ways.

## Alias tasks

```javascript
task.registerTask(taskName, [description, ] taskList);
```

_Note that for alias tasks, the description is optional. If omitted, a useful description will be added for you automatically._

In the following example, a `theworks` task is defined that, when invoked by `grunt theworks`, will execute the `lint`, `qunit`, `concat` and `min` tasks in-order. Running `grunt theworks` behaves exactly as if `grunt lint qunit concat min` was run on the command line.

```javascript
task.registerTask('theworks', 'lint qunit concat min');
```

In this example, a default task is defined that, when invoked by `grunt` or `grunt default`, will execute the `lint`, `qunit`, `concat` and `min` tasks in-order. It behaves exactly as if `grunt lint qunit concat min` was run on the command line.

```javascript
task.registerTask('default', 'lint qunit concat min');
```

_In case it's not obvious, defining a `default` task is helpful because it runs by default, whenever you run `grunt` without explicitly specifying tasks._
