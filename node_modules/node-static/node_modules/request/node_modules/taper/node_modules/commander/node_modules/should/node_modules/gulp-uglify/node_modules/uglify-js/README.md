UglifyJS 2
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)

UglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.

This page documents the command line utility.  For
[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).
There's also an
[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,
Chrome and probably Safari).

Install
-------

First make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
(You may need to restart your computer after this step).

From NPM for use as a command line app:

    npm install uglify-js -g

From NPM for programmatic use:

    npm install uglify-js

From Git:

    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git
    cd UglifyJS2
    npm link .

Usage
-----

    uglifyjs [input files] [options]

UglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the
input files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files
in sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the
same global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some
variable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.

If you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input
files.

The available options are:

```
  --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.
                                                                        [string]
  --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the
                     source map.                                        [string]
  --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //#
                     sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with
                     --source-map.                                      [string]
  --source-map-include-sources
                     Pass this flag if you want to include the content of
                     source files in the source map as sourcesContent
                     property.                                         [boolean]
  --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was
                     generated from some other original code.
  --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance
                     with Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS
                     will try to be IE-proof).                         [boolean]
  --expr             Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for
                     parsing JSON)                                     [boolean]
  -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source
                     maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file
                     names and ensure they are relative paths. You can also
                     specify -p relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out
                     itself the relative paths between original sources, the
                     source map and the output file.                    [string]
  -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).
  -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]
  -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]
  -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.
  -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options
                     like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no
                     argument to use the default compression options.   [string]
  -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]
  -e, --enclose      Embed everything in a big function, with a configurable
                     parameter/argument list.                           [string]
  --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this
                     works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments
                     that contain "@license" or "@preserve". You can optionally
                     pass one of the following arguments to this flag:
                     - "all" to keep all comments
                     - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep
                     only comments that match.
                     Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when
                     compression is on, because of dead code removal or
                     cascading statements into sequences.               [string]
  --preamble         Preamble to prepend to the output.  You can use this to
                     insert a comment, for example for licensing information.
                     This will not be parsed, but the source map will adjust
                     for its presence.
  --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]
  --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]
  --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).
                                                                       [boolean]
  --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies
                     --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]
  --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”
                     and “global” variables available. You need to pass an
                     argument to this option to specify the name that your
                     module will take when included in, say, a browser.
                                                                        [string]
  --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to
                     automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]
  --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]
  -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]
  -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]
```

Specify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output
goes to STDOUT.

## Source map options

UglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for
debugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass
`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the
source map dumped).

Additionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the
original files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input
files to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of
directories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source
map.

For example:

    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \
             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \
             -o foo.min.js \
             --source-map foo.min.js.map \
             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \
             -p 5 -c -m

The above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the
output in `foo.min.
